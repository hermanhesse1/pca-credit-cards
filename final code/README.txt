Outline of R code

- First run the "final code knn basic" R file; this uses the dataset.xls file from the UCI page (will have to save this as .csv) for code to work
- This file creates "ohe28_cleaned_data.csv" , used in the next R file: Alex.R
- Run the Alex.R code
- Next, run the 'code data clean for DL.R' file which creates the dataset used in the next two files
- Next, run the 'Cross_Validation_final.R' file
- Next, run the 'Deep_Learning_Final.R' file
